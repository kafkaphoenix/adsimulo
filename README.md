# Ad Simulo: civilisation simulator on a procedural universe.
## Goals & motto

- Creation of a full fledged civilisation emulator.
- "E terris ad astra" (From the land to the stars).

## Getting started

The quickstart assumes that you have Python 3 up and running. The instructions below are written with Linux/POSIX in mind.

If you're a MacOS user, it is presumed that you have installed python3 yourself somehow (e.g. using pyenv).
If you're a Windows user, remember to use Scripts\activate.bat instead of .bin/activate.

```
# Installing:
$ python3 -m venv .
$ . bin/activate
$ pip install -e .
[..]
Successfully installed adsimulo-0.1.0 [..]

# Starting the game
$ adsimulo-run [options]

# Debugging
$ adsimulo-debug [options]
```

Note that adsimulo's scripts will create whatever files they need to operate right in the directory
where they're being called.
Please check the [documentation](https://github.com/kafkaphoenix/adsimulo/blob/main/docs/scripts.md)
 for more information about script arguments.
